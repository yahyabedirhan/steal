# Steal

Point at any element on a web page and copy it straight to your clipboard, in
whatever shape you need it: the full HTML, a cleaned-up version, plain text, or
Markdown. The name is a joke. Steal only ever writes to your clipboard and sends
nothing anywhere.

It is a local, unpacked Chrome extension. There is no store listing and no
account.

## Why

Getting one specific element off a page usually means opening DevTools, picking
the node, and choosing Copy element, and what you get back is every class, every
`data-*`, and every icon SVG. Most of the time you just want to remember what a
section said, or paste it into your notes, not reproduce how it was built. Steal
is a one-key way to grab an element and choose how much of it comes across.

## How it works

1. Click the **Steal** toolbar icon, or press **Cmd+Shift+S** (macOS) /
   **Ctrl+Shift+S** (Windows/Linux). An `ON` badge appears on the icon and the
   page switches to a crosshair cursor. This only affects the tab you turned it
   on in.
2. Move the mouse. The element under the cursor is highlighted with a blue box,
   and a floating label names it and previews what would be copied.
3. Fine-tune the selection with the arrow keys, without moving the mouse:
   - **Up / Down** previous / next element (falls back to the parent, or to the
     next element further up, so a lone child still steps somewhere)
   - **Left** parent element
   - **Right** first child element

   Traversal skips `head`, `script`, `style` and friends, so **Right** on
   `<html>` lands on `<body>`. Moving the mouse again always re-selects whatever
   is under the cursor.
4. Press **1**–**4** to pick the copy mode (see below). The label updates to
   show the active mode's icon and a live preview. Your choice is remembered for
   next time.
5. **Click** the element, or press **Enter**, to copy it. A small toast confirms
   what was copied, and inspect mode turns itself off.
6. Press **Esc**, press the shortcut again, or click the toolbar icon to leave
   inspect mode without copying.

The copy is page content only. Steal's own highlight box, label, and toast are
never included, and any temporary change Steal made to the page is undone before
the copy is taken, even when you copy `<body>` or the whole `<html>`.

Chrome does not allow a bare `Shift+S` for extension shortcuts, so the default
needs a `Ctrl` / `Alt` / `Command` modifier. Rebind it at
`chrome://extensions/shortcuts`.

## Copy modes

Press the number key while inspecting to switch. The choice persists across
sessions, so a new inspection starts in the mode you last used.

| Key | Mode | What you get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | Full HTML | The selected HTML exactly as it is on the page, pretty-printed with 2-space indentation. Nothing removed. |
| **2** | Clean HTML | The same structure with the noise stripped: styling and behavior attributes gone (only things like image sources and link targets kept), empty and icon-only subtrees dropped, layout-only wrappers unwrapped. |
| **3** | Plain Text | The words, with their block structure but no markup. Each paragraph, heading, and list item on its own line; lists numbered or bulleted; code blocks kept verbatim; inline scripts and style blocks dropped. |
| **4** | Markdown | A best-effort Markdown version for pasting into notes: headings, bold / italic / strikethrough, inline and fenced code, links, images, lists, blockquotes, and rules. Only what the HTML tags say is converted; styling classes are ignored. Tables are flattened to text. |

The hover label shows a live character count of what would actually be copied
for Clean HTML, Plain Text, and Markdown, so you can judge scope before you
click.

## Install

1. Run `npm install`, then `npm run build`. This produces a `dist/` folder,
   which is the complete, self-contained extension.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` and enable **Developer mode** (top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and choose the `dist/` folder.
4. Pin the icon from the puzzle-piece menu.

The extension stays installed across restarts as long as the folder stays put.

### After changing the code

- Run `npm run build` again, or leave `npm run dev` running for a watch build.
- Click the reload icon on the extension card in `chrome://extensions`.
- Reload any page you want to test on. The content script is injected fresh on
  each activation and does not hot-update an already-open page.

## Development

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build` | Build `dist/` (two passes: the content script and the service worker). |
| `npm run dev` | The same build in watch mode. |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` in strict mode. |
| `npm test` | Run the test suite with Vitest (jsdom). |
| `npm run gen-icons` | Regenerate the placeholder crosshair icons (`tools/gen-icons.py`, standard library only). |

The source is TypeScript under `src/`, built by Vite. `dist/` is generated and
gitignored. `demo.html` is a manual test page with nested lists, links, and
buttons.
