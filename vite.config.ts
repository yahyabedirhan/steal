/**
 * Two self-contained bundles, one per entry, built in separate passes
 * (`--mode content`, `--mode background`).
 *
 * - Content scripts are injected by `chrome.scripting.executeScript({ files })`,
 *   which cannot load ES modules, so each entry is emitted as a standalone IIFE
 *   with every dependency inlined — no shared chunk between the two.
 * - `dist/` is wiped once by `npm run clean` before the first pass; neither pass
 *   empties it, so the second bundle lands beside the first.
 * - The background pass also copies the static files (`manifest.json`, `icons/`,
 *   `content.css`) so `dist/` is the complete "Load unpacked" folder.
